            Google stands among the paragons of post-modern technological
            advancement and might very well be the most recognized company name
            since the dawn of history. Very few know that the secret behind its
            rich tapestry of algorithms isn't a roll of die or deal of hand, but
            unravels to be a company with an exemplary organizational culture.
            In this article, I illuminate Google's organizational culture and
            how it has furthered the tech-collosus in its ventures.
